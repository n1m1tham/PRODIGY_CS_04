# Basic Keylogger

This Python keylogger records and logs keystrokes on a system, saving them to a file. **This tool is intended for educational and ethical purposes only.** Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes and saves them to a file (`keylog.txt`).
- Captures special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Backspace).
- Stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

This keylogger uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard inputs. Install it using pip:
